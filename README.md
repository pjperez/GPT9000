# GPT-9000 Terminal

A retro-style ChatGPT terminal UI you can run in any browser. Looks and feels like an old-school green CRT.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Paste your OpenAI API key when asked (it's only stored locally).
3. Start typing prompts or try terminal commands.

## Terminal Commands

- `help`, `logout`, `clear`, `version`, `model`
- `fortune`, `motd`, `system info`, `beep`, `ascii <text>`
- `pwd`, `ls`, `cd <dir>`, `cat <file>`

## Deploying

Just drag and drop the folder into:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel

## Safety

Your API key is stored in your browser only (localStorage). Never share it or use this on public/shared devices.
